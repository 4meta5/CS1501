 # Economics Track

 This track focuses on economics/governance related to blockchain technology. To get an idea of the type of material we'll assign for reading in this track, read David Hoffman's article on [Incentive Loops](ttps://medium.com/@Trustless_State/incentive-loops-how-crypto-actually-fixes-stuff-a7aa7aa3ae04) and Josh Stark's [Introduction to Cryptoeconomics](https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-cryptoeconomics-5edea77e4e8d). Our work will heavily reference [Radical Markets](http://radicalmarkets.com); we suggest buying a print copy!

 All resources are stored in the numbered directories in the current directory. Typical resources that may be placed in the numbered directories include:
 1. [Reading Resources](#reading)
 2. [Paths](#paths)
 3. [Quiz](#quiz)

 ## Reading
 
 In terms of reading, we'll offer 5-10 reading resources per week. These readings tend to follow a common trend. Each of the readings is placed in a subdirectory in the current directory according to the order in which they were created. 
<!-- could have them guess the trend on fridays for the 10 minute kahoot quiz-->
<!-- an even better idea is to build questions for all of the readings -->

## Paths

Paths are designed to organize knowledge according to specific narratives or macro trends. Often times, it can be helpful to trace the origin of modern ideas.

## Quiz

There may be quizzes that go along with the resources to test reading comprehension. 

<!-- consider offering some sort of competition where people can submit notes that summarize the reading in a very short number of words; I can do this for the first week -->

# Building Apps

 # Cryptography Track

This track is focused on building blockchain applications and interacting with the blockchain. The resources provided students on this track will mainly consist of tutorials/repos. There is an emphasis on coding, and resources are usually organized according to programming language.

 All resources are stored in the numbered directories in the current directory. Typical resources that may be placed in the numbered directories include:
 1. [Reading Resources](#reading)
 2. [Paths](#paths)
 3. [Quiz](#quiz)

 ## Reading
 
 In terms of reading, we'll offer 5-10 reading resources per week. These readings tend to follow a common trend. Each of the readings is placed in a subdirectory in the current directory according to the order in which they were created. 
<!-- could have them guess the trend on fridays for the 10 minute kahoot quiz-->
<!-- an even better idea is to build questions for all of the readings -->

## Paths

Paths are designed to organize knowledge according to specific narratives or macro trends. Often times, it can be helpful to trace the origin of modern ideas. For this track, paths are usually organized by programming language.

## Quiz

There may be quizzes that go along with the resources to test reading comprehension. 

<!-- consider offering some sort of competition where people can submit notes that summarize the reading in a very short number of words; I can do this for the first week -->

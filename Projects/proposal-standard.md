Model this after EIPs but make it as short as possible
```

        project_summary: __,

        name (optional): __,
}

```
When a proposal is submitted, it is first sent into a discussion feed. It must achieve some level of support before it can be formally added to the list of open projects. Open projects usually have roles posted that describe an informal criteria that may be suitable for the position. We encourage any involved projects to be accessible to students of all experience levels.

## Learning Rust
> Taken from [thePGoat](https://github.com/thePGoat/madamePsychosis)

Start with [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), then [The Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/). Consider building a small personal project while you're learning the language -- this preferrably should not be something *cutting edge*. It is better to start with something small and iteratively add to it instead of setting lofty, unrealistic goals from the start.

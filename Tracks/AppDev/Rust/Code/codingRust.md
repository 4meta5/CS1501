# Coding Rust Notes

Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.

These are notes from [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). They start from the middle of the Chapter 2 ```guessing_game``` tutorial.

## Guessing Game (Ch.2) <a name="guess"></a>
Switching from an ```expect``` call to a ```match``` expression is how you generally move from crashing on an error to handling the error.


## Immutability <a name="immutablity"></a>
* [Variables and Type Annotations](#variables)
* [Ownership](#ownership)

### Variables and Type Annotations <a name="variables"></a>
* Variables are by default immutable.
* Rust has two compound types: tuples and arrays. In Rust, both are fixed length.
* Type annotations enable static checking. 

Consider comparing performance for different data structures between mutable implementations and *functional*-style code that relies on immutability (which is safer for concurrency).

### Ownership <a name="ownership"></a>
Some languages (ie Java) have garbage collection that constantly looks for memory that is no longer being used. In other languages (C++), the programmer must explicity allocate and deallocate (free) memory. In **Rust**, memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time.

Rules: <br>
1. Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its *owner*.
2. There can only be one owner at a time.
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

For **string literals**, the textis hardcoded directly into the final executable, enabling us to store this data on the stack. Although its immutability limits what we can do with this data type, storing string literals on the stack means that string literals are fast and efficient. Conversely, **String type** supports a mutable, growable piece of text by allocating memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means that the memory must be requested from the OS at runtime. 

In Rust, garbage collection is managed by deallocating memory in the heap whenever a variable goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls ```drop``` to deallocate its memory. This pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item's lifetime is known as *Resource Acquisition is Initializaion (RAII)*.

If you've heard the terms *shallow copy* and *deep copy* while working with other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. However, Rust only enables moves and not shallow copies because the pointer is invalidated as soon as the data is removed. This prevents *double free error*.

Rust has a special annotation called the ```Copy``` trait that we place on types like integers that are stored on the satck. If a type has the ```Copy``` trait, an older variable is still usable after assignment. Rust won't let us annotate a type with the ```Copy``` trait if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the ```Drop``` trait. Here are some of the types that are ```Copy```: <br>
* All the integer types, such as ```u32```
* The Boolean type, ```bool```, with values ```true``` and ```false```.
* All the floating point types, such as ```f64```.
* The character type, ```char```.
* Tuples but only if they contain types that are also ```Copy```. For example, ```(i32, i32)``` is ```Copy```, but not ```(i32, String)```.

The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by ```drop``` unless the data has been moved to be owned by another variable.

**References and Borrowing** <br>

We use **references** to pass a value to a function without transferring ownership.

```
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, nothing happens.
```
Using references as function parameters is known as **borrowing**. References are immutable by default, but mutable references are possible. The only limitation is that you can only have one mutable reference per piece of data in a scope. 
> We can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not *simultaneous* ones.

This allows for mutation, but in a very controlled fashion. This allows Rust to prevent **data races** at compile time. A data race is a race condition in which: <br>
* Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
* At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
* There's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

---

**Slices**<br>
```
let hello = &s[0..5];
let world = &s[6..11];
```
```
let hello = &s[0..=4];
let world = &s[6..=10];
```
They're the same; the top is noninclusive for the last number and the second syntax is inclusive for the second number.

String literals are immutable because ```&str``` (string literal type) is an immutable reference.

## Basic Programming Concepts <a name="basics"></a>
* [Shadowing](#shadowing)
* [The Stack and the Heap](#stackheap)

### Shadowing <a name="shadowing"></a>
Shadowing is different than marking a variable as ```mut```, because weâ€™ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the ```let``` keyword. By using ```let```, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed. [Chapter 3 of The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html)

### The Stack and the Heap <a name="stackheap"></a>
In a systems programming language like Rust, whether a value is on the stack or the heap influences how you can interact with it.

The **stack** stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order (LIFO = last in, first out). The stack is fast because of the way it accesses the data: it never has to search for a place to put new ata or a place to get data from because it can only pop or push values from the top of the stack. All data on the stack must take up a known, fixed size.

When the size of data is unknown at compile time, this data is stored on the **heap**. To put data on the heap, you request some space from the OS and the OS provides a pointer to the address of that location. This process is called *allocating on the heap*. Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a point to get there. Allocating a large amount of space on the heap can also take time

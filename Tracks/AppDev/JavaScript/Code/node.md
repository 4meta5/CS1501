## Node.js

For getting started with ```Node.js```, my recommendation would be to first take a step back and consider why you want to learn Node. Consider reading [Client-Server Overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview)
and [Express/Node Introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction). It helps to have an appreciation for software before interacting with it. This should encourage students to establish a strong foundation instead of trying to learn '*just enough*' to build a side project. 

Next, I would consider thinking of a database application that could be useful for you. Use the [Express LocalLibrary Tutorial](https://github.com/mdn/express-locallibrary-tutorial) to build **your** database. It is a useful learning exercise to build something yourself instead of following a tutorial (I recommend using the LocalLibrary tutorial to build your own database with unique schema).

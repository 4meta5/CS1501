# From Incentives to Network Security

We'll focus on incentives at the beginning of class. Then, we'll eventually transition to the Byzantine Generals Problem. We'll use that to motivate discussions regarding Byzantine Fault Tolernace, PBFT, Tendermint, Parity Substrate, ane Polkadot.

**Agenda:**
1. Eric from Blockchain Research Lab is coming to speak to the class.
2. Quiz on Assigned Readings (Kahoot) and **keep track of points and gamify the class**
3. Review Incentive Management
4. Discuss Network Security
5. Next Class (guest speaker: Josh Cincinatti)

**Assigned Readings:**
- [Blockchain Underpinnings: Hashing](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/blockchain-underpinnings-hashing-7f4746cbd66b)
    * Desirable properties of hash functions:
        * **pre-image resistant:** it is mathematically and computationally improbable to determine the input given the output (also known as a one-way function).
        * Collision-resistant: 
    Hash functions are pre-image resistant (it is mathematically and computationally improbable to determine the input given the output). Hash functions are often describes as one-way functions, but they are also collision-resistant (no two inputs map to the same output). It is also important to note that hash functions provide fixed-length outputs.

- [Public Key Cryptography Stack Exchange Explanation]
- [Chapter 1 of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies Textbook]
- [Bitcoin's Academic Pedigree]
- [Bitcoin White Paper]

## Managing Incentives with Blockchain
* **recommend the book Radical Markets; if possible, explain QV and token bonding or I can do that later and provide that as a path tonight**

Tokens add an incentive model to the development of networking protocols. 

If you're an engineer, you can make more money working on open source systems than at Facebook or Google or Amazon. 

## Network Security
-- byzantine generals paper
-- use this time to motivate deep dive into all the papers (use bitcoin's pedigree and some other stuff)

### PBFT

## Modern Protocols motivated by PBFT 
* Polkadot
* Tendermint/Cosmos
* Casper
* any BFT blockchain

## Next Week
* Josh Cincinnatti

# CS1501
UVA Introduction to Blockchain
 [Website](https://uvablockchain.gitbook.io)

 # Tracks
There are three main tracks for the UVA CS1501 Introduction to Blockchain:
1. [Cryptography](#CryptoTrack)
2. [Economics/Governance](#CryptoEconTrack)
3. [Application Building](#App)

Students may participate in 1, 2, or all 3 tracks. Each track will provide participants with reading resources. In class, we will cover an interesting mix of all three tracks. In the future, we may offer other activities/opportunities for students in each track.

 ## Course Goals
We decided to organize the class into three tracks because blockchain technology is multi-disciplinary and pulls from cryptography, network security, game theory, and monetary policy among other subjects. Our hope is to provide a comprehensive introduction to fundamental blockchain concepts. 

 ## Repo Organization
Each <Number> directory holds the powerpoint, lecture notes, and tweets for the given week. The tweets are posted by @smerklenetwork. The tracks directory holds the resources for each week. The topic schedule as well as more information about each track is contained in the /tracks/README.md file. The Projects directory contains other project ideas as well as current opportunities in the UVA blockchain ecosystem.

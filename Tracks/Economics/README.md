# Incentives, 
* Brock Pierce Speech
* Incentives

* Introduce Proof of Work (blackbox cryptography and assume knowledge)
* what does governance really mean?
* what does censorship resistance mean and how is it based on price?

End with some stuff on tradeoffs typically between PoS and PoW. How PBFT already provides a way to scale transaction throughput when we make the network permissioned. Good references include Polkadot

## Tracks
* They start next week; this week, we didn't plan much outside of class but I provided a lot of reading resources

1. Cryptography
2. Economics/Governance
3. BUIDL

## Projects
These correspond to each track as well.

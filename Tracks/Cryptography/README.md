 # Cryptography Track

 This track focuses on cryptography related to blockchain technology. The first few weeks focus on establishing fundamental concepts before exposing students to more modern constructions. 

 ## Reading
 
 In terms of reading, we'll offer 7 main reading resources per week. These readings tend to follow a common trend. Each of the readings is placed in a subdirectory in the current directory according to the order in which they were created. 
<!-- could have them guess the trend on fridays for the 10 minute kahoot quiz-->
<!-- an even better idea is to build questions for all of the readings -->


## Quiz

There may be quizzes that go along with the reading to test reading comprehension. 

<!-- consider offering some sort of competition where people can submit notes that summarize the reading in a very short number of words; I can do this for the first week -->

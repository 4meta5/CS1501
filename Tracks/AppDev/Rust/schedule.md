# Schedule <a name="schedule"></a>

This program is 12 weeks long. It starts by introducing [Rust](https://paritytech.io/why-rust/) before gradually increasing the amount of time spent on blockchain side projects. **To join this program, email ars9he@virginia.edu**

> We encourage students to spend *at least* 1 hour a day for any program that they decide to follow.

The program is split into 6 **two-week sprints**. Each sprint focuses on different aspects of JavaScript and blockchain programming. The last 3 sprints are personalized depending on the progress made by the student.
* [Introducing Rust and Blockchain](#sprint1)
* [More Rust and Some Parity/Ethereum](#sprint2)
* [Parity/Polkadot](#sprint3)

This program is extremely malleable. **Where we start and how far we go depends entirely on the student's background and level of commitment**.

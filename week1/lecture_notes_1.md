## State of the Space

Notes:

For the class, my main goals are to 
(1) -->foster intellectual curiosity
(2) -->provide tools/guidance to enable your success in this space
We are peers and will learn together. Think of this whole class as a massive experiment and my goal is to make so that we can share the knowledge that we have with each other. (2 heads are better than 1 comic)...emphasize fact that everyone has an area to contribute

This is going to be the least technical lecture. I'm teaching to a wide range of audiences. Some of you may be too advanced for this class
-->for you, I want to do these things
----encourage side projects and help you with them
----enable your personal development; building the skills that will be useful in the future and positioning yourself in this space

for the intermediate crowd;
-->plug you into great sources of knowledge in the space
-->make you aware of opportunities to build and contribute

for the new people;
-->introduce to you the space
-->foster curiosity and enable exploration

Historical perspective:
--concept of a database
--want a place to store data and make sure that it stays there
--keeping history can be useful for many reasons
--twitter is a database of tweets that twitter controls
----they allow you to change a subset of the database (your tweets) 
----they are the gatekeepers so they can shut down the network or change your history whenever they want (you are not in control of your data/information, they are)

--then, we started thinking of the concept of distributed database to scale computation, storage, etc.
--but these were still controlled/managed by the same cloud provider, etc. (Amazon, Google pics)

--paradigm shift with the Bitcoin Whitepaper
--end of 2008, bank bailout and financial crisis
----Satoshi Nakamoto released this paper onto a mailing list
----described a model that could enable the creation of a distributed database that wasn't controlled by 
any single person/entity...it creates a method to create some percent share over the database (this is called trustless, you don't need to trust the other people that are maintaining the database...the reason is because everyone can basically act in their self-interest and everything will be secure)
----the database is owned by the superset of everyone on the network; 
blockchain:
--you have some state and you want to make changes to it
--so the changes must reference the previous state and this creates an immutable history of changes
--define immutable...put some data out there and have it stay there and not change
--in the database, we tracked how much money someone has and that's bitcoin
--So at a high level, this works in a way where I decide I want to send some amount to someone else so I sign a message/transaction and send that to the network and everyone network validates the transaction by referencing the previous state and verifies that I have those funds and the transaction is legitimate before adding it to the block, which enables and symbolizes transfer of value
--people called miners are in charge of doing the verification
--just a database with very specific rules on how it can change


Costs
--Because this is a decentralized network, you can't really use it for free because its supported by lots of hardware, etc so the way this works is that

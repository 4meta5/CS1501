# Coding Rust Cheatsheet (2 of 2)

Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.

These are notes from [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), but they also may draw from [Steve Donovan's Gentle Intro](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/readme.html). **These notes only cover the last 7 chapters of The Book**

## Closures: Anonymous Functions that Capture the Environment <a name="closure"></a>
Rust's closures are anonymous functions that you can store in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions. Closures capture values from  the scope in which they're called, enabling code reuse and behavior customization.

```
let closure_example = |param| {
    println!("This is just an example closure");
    param
}
closure_example(15);
```

Closures are usually short and relevant only within a narrow context rather than in any arbitrary scenario. Within these limited contexts, the compiler is reliably able to infer the types of the parameters and the return type, similar to how itâ€™s able to infer the types of most variables.

As with variables, we can add type annotations if we want to increase explicitness and clarity at the cost of being more verbose than is strictly necessary. 

```
let closure_example_annotated = |param: u32| -> u32 {
    println!("Annotated example");
    param
}
```

Closure definitions will have one concrete type inferred for each of their parameters and for their return value. The compiler will not allow calling the same closure twice with two different inferred types (ie ```closure_example("fire")``` and then ```closure_example(32)```).

---
**Storing Closures Using Generic Parameters and the ```Fn``` Traits**<br>

The code pattern known as *memoization* or *lazy evaluation* involves creating a struct to hold the closure as well as the value returned by calling the closure. Specifically, the struct executes the closure only if we need the return value and it will cache the result, thereby enabling the rest of the code to reuse this result.

Every struct definition requires the types for each of its fields. To define structs, enums, or function parameters that use closures, we use generics and trait bounds. All closures implement at least one of the traits: ```Fn```, ```FnMut``` or ```FnOnce```.

We add types to the ```Fn``` trait bound to represent the types of the parameters and return values the closures must have to match this trait bound. 

```
struct Cacher<T>
    where T: Fn(u32) -> u32
{
    calculation: T,
    value: Option<u32>,
}
```

This ```Cacher``` struct has a ```calculation``` field of the generic type ```T```. The trait bounds on ```T``` specify that it's a closure by using the ```Fn``` trait. 

> While functions can implement all of the ```Fn``` traits, closures are better for caputuring a value from the environment.

The ```value``` field has type ```Option<32>```. Before executing the closure, the ```value``` is ```None```. Once code using ```Cacher``` asks for the *result* of the closure, the ```Cacher``` executes the closure and stores the result in a ```Some``` variant in the ```value``` field. This ensures that if the code asks for the result of the closure again, ```Cacher``` can return the result stored in the ```Some``` variant. Here is the logic in code form:

```
impl<T> Cacher<T>
    where T: Fn(u32) -> u32
{
    fn new(calculation:T) -> Cacher<T> {
        Cacher {
            calculation,
            value: None,
        }
    }

    fn value(&mut self, arg: u32) -> u32 {
        match self.value {
            Some(v) => v,
            None => {
                let v = (self.calculation)(arg);
                self.value = Some(v);
                v
            },
        }
    }
}
```

The ```Cacher::new``` function takes a generic parameter ```T```, which we've defined as maintaining the same trait bound as the ```Cacher``` struct. ```Cacher::new``` returns a ```Cacher``` instance which holds the closure that was specified in the ```calculation``` field as well as ```None``` in the ```value``` field (because we haven't executed the closure yet). 

> The fields for ```Cacher``` are kept private because we want to manage the struct fields' values instead of letting the calling code change these values directly.

Even so, this implementation suffers a fundamental problem whereby if we call the closure with one value, then the value is cached and we can no longer call the closure with a new value. We can modify this implementation to alleviate this problem by holding a hash map instead of a single value. We can also introduce more generic parameters to increase the flexibility of this implementation (thereby allowing it to accept and/or return more than one type). *I plan to explore these improvements in a workout app, which may be pushed to my github soon.*

---
**Tradeoffs for Using Closures vs Functions**<br>
When a closure captures a value from its environment, it uses memory to store the values for use in te closure body. This incurs more memory overhead than a normal function, which does not capture its environment.

Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways, each of which directly map to the ways that a function can take a parameter:
1. **taking ownership** => ```FnOnce``` consumes the variables it captures from its enclosing scope (otherwise known as the closure's *environment*). To consume the captured variables, the closure must take ownership of these variables and move them into the closure once it is defined. 
> The ```Once``` part of the name indicates that the closure can't take ownership of the same variables more than once (so it can be called only once).<br>
2. **borrowing mutably** => ```FnMut``` can change the environment because it mutably borrows values.
3. **borrowing immutably** => ```Fn``` borrows values from the environment immutably.

> When you create a closure, Rust will infer which trait to use based on how the closure manages the variables from the environment. All closures implement ```FnOnce```, but closures that don't move the captured variables also implement ```FnMut```, and closures that don't need mutable access to the captured variables also implement ```Fn```. 

We use the ```move``` keyword before the parameter list to force closures to take ownership of the values that it uses in the environment. Example:

```
fn main() {
    let x = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let equal_to_x = move |z| z == x;

    println!("can't use x here: {:?}", x); 
    // the above line will most definitely will give us a compilation error
}
```

> Easy way to start with closures is to use ```Fn``` and the compiler will tell you whether you need to add ```FnMut``` or ```FnOnce``` based on what happens inside the closure body. 

## Processing a Series of Items with Iterators <a name="iterator">

In Rust, iterators are *lazy* such that they have no effect until we call methods that consume the iterator (to use it). Here's the syntax for creating an iterator over the items in a vector.

```
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

let v1_iter = v1.iter();

for val in v1_iter {
    println!("Got: {}", val);
}
```

---
**The ```Iterator``` Trait and the ```next``` Method**<br>
All iterators implement the trait ```Iterator```, which has the definition:

```
trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;

    // methods with default implementations elided
}
```

This definition tells us that implementing the ```Iterator``` trait requires defining an ```Item``` type, which is used in the return type of the ```next``` method. 

> The ```Iterator``` trait only requires implementators to define one method: the ```next``` method, which returns one item of the iterator at a time, which is wrapped in ```Some``` and, when the iteration is over, returns ```None```.

Although we don't need to make an iterator mutable for a ```for``` loop (because the loop takes ownership and makes it mutable behind the scenes), we would need to define the iterator as mutable if we are successively calling ```next``` (because each ```next``` call eats up an item from the iterator).

> The values we get from calls to ```next``` are immutable references to the values in the vector. The ```iter``` method produces an iterator over immutable references. If we want to create an iterator that takes ownership of ```v1``` and returns owned values, we can call ```into_iter``` instead of ```iter```. If we want to iterate over mutable references, we can call ```iter_mut``` (instead of ```iter```).

---
**Methods that Consume the Iterator**<br>
The ```Iterator``` trait maintains default methods provided by the standard library, some of which call the ```next``` method in their definition. Methods that call ```next``` are referred to as *consuming adaptors* because calling them uses up the iterator. An example is the ```sum``` method, which takes ownership of the iterator and iterates through items by repeatedly called ```next``` (which therefore consumes the iterator upon each call). As it iterates through the given object (maybe a vector), it adds each item to a running total and returns the total once the iteration is complete.

```
#[test]
fn iterator_sum() {
    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    
    let v1_iter = v1.iter();

    let total: i32 = v1_iter.sum();

    assert_eq!(total, 6);
}
```

> Note that we cannot use ```v1_iter``` after the call to ```sum``` because ```sum``` takes ownership of the iterator that we call.

---
**Methods that Produce Other Iterators**<br>
Other methods defined on the ```Iterator``` trait known as *iterator adaptors* enable you to change iterators into different kinds of iterators. Because all iterators are lazy, you still need to call one of the consuming adaptor methods to get results from calls to iterator adaptors.

```
let v1: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1);
```

The above code calls the iterator adaptor ```map```, which takes a closure to call on each item to produce a new iterator. but the closure we've specified never gets called because **iterator adaptors are lazy** (so we need to consume the iterator). We can fix this by using the ```collect``` method to consume the iterator and colllect the resulting variables into a collection data type.

```
let v1: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

let v2: Vec<_> = v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1).collect();

assert_eq!(v2, vec![2, 3, 4]);
```

Because ```map``` takes a closure, we can specify any operation that we want to perform on each item. This provides a solid example of how closures enable customized behavior while also reusing the iteration behavior provided by the ```Iterator``` trait.

---
**Using Closures that Capture Their Environment**<br>
The ```filter``` iterator adaptor is a method on an iterator. ```filter``` takes a closure that takes each item from the iterator and returns a Boolean. If the closure returns ```true```, the  value will be included in the iterator produced by ```filter```. Conversely, if the closure returns ```false```, the value cannot be included in the resulting iterator. Here is an example with syntax:

```
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
struct Student {
    name: String,
    score: u32,
}

fn pass_or_fail(students: Vec<Student>, passing_score: u32) -> Vec<Student> {
    students.into_iter()
        .filter(|s| s.score >= passing_score)
        .collect()
}

#[test]
fn filter_by_score() {
    let students = vec![
        Student { name: String::from("Bob"), score: 2300 },
        Student { name: String::from("Alice"), score: 2250 },
        Student { name: String::from("Charlie"), score: 1500 },
    ];

    let passing = pass_or_fail(students, 2000)

    assert_eq!(
        passing,
        vec![
            Student { name: String::from("Bob"), score: 2300 },
            Student { name: String::from("Alice"), score: 2250 },
        ]
    );
}
```

---
**Creating Our Own Iterators with the ```Iterator``` Trait**<br>
If we want to create our own iterators using the ```Iterator``` trait, we only need to provide a definition for the ```next``` method, and we can use all other methods that have default implementations provided by the ```Iterator``` trait. Here's a super simple example:

```
struct Counter {
    count: u32,
}

impl Counter {
    fn new() -> Counter {
        Counter { count: 0 }
    }
}

impl Iterator for Counter {
    type Item = u32;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.count += 1;

        if self.count < 6 {
            Some(self.count)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we set the associated ```Item``` type for our iterator to ```u32```. This indicates that the iterator will return ```u32``` values. We want our iterator to add 1 to the current state so we initialized ```count``` to 0 so it returns 1 first. If the value of ```count``` is less than 6, ```next``` will return the current value wrapped in ```Some```, but if ```count``` is 6 or higher, our iterator will return ```None```.

Because we already implemented the ```Iterator``` trait by defining the ```next``` method, we now can use any of the ```Iterator``` trait method's default implementations. As an example, let's say that we want to take the values produced by an instance of ```Counter```, pair them with values produced by another ```Counter``` instance after skipping the first value, multiply each pair together, keep only those reulsts that are divisible by 3, and add all the resulting values together, we could do as like this:

```
#[test]
fn using_other_iterator_trait_methods() {
    let sum: u32 = Counter::new().zip(Counter::new().skip(1))
                                    .map(|(a, b)| a * b)
                                    .filter(|x| x % 3 == 0)
                                    .sum();
    assert_eq!(18, sum);
}
```

### Comparing Performance: Loops vs Iterators <a name="loopsvsiterators"></a>

Although iterators are a high-level abstraction, they are compiled down to roughly the same code as if you'd written the lower-level code yourself. Specifically, iterators are one of Rust's *zero-cost abstractions* (<=> the abstraction imposes no additional runtime overhead). Bjarne Stroustrup defined *zero-overhead* in "Foundations of C++"(2012) 
> "In general, C++ implementations obey the zero-overhead principle: What you don't use, you don't pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn't hand code any better."

When Rust knows the number of iterations for a loop, it can "unroll" the loop. *Unrolling* is an optimization that removes the overhead of the loop controlling code and instead generates repititive code for each iteration of the loop.

## Cargo and Crates <a name="cargo"></a>

> For more details, check out [Cargo Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)

*Release profiles* in Rust are predefined and customizable profiles with different configurations that allow a programmer to have more control over various options for compiling code. Each profile is configured independently of the others!

Cargo has two main profiles:
1. the ```dev``` profile is used implicitly whenever you run ```cargo build```
2. the ```release``` profile requires invoking the ```--release``` flag (```cargo build --release```)

Here are the default values for the ```opt-level``` setting for the ```dev``` and ```release``` profiles in the Cargo.toml file. The ```opt-level``` setting controls the number of optimizations that Rust applies to the code (ranging from 0 to 3). Although applying more optimizations enables faster runtime, it also extends compiling time (so if you're in development mode, it's better to pick a lower ```opt-level```).

```
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0

[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
```

---
**Making Useful Documentation Comments**<br>
Documentation comments use three slashes ```///``` instead of two and support Markdown notation for formatting the text. Place documentation comments right before the item that they're documenting. Here's an example (some markdown inception LOL):

```
/// Adds one to the number given
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let five = 5;
///
/// assert_eq!(6, my_crate::add_one(5));
/// ```
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

We can generate the HTML documentation from this documentation comment by running ```cargo doc```. This command runs the ```rustdoc``` tool distributed in Rust and puts the generated HTML documentation in the *target/doc* directory. Running ```cargo doc --open``` builds the HTML and opens the result in a web browser.

Here are a few sections that crate authors commonly use in their documentation:
* **Examples**
* **Panics**: the scenarios in which the function being documented could panic
* **Errors**: if the function returns a ```Result```, describing the kinds of errors that may occur and what conditions might cause those errors to be returned can be helpful to callers so that they can write code to handle the different potential errors.
* **Safety**: If the function is ```unsafe``` to call, there should be a section explaining why the function is unsafe as well as which invariants the function expects the callers to uphold.

> Interestingly, runnning ```cargo test``` will run the code examples in the documentation as tests. This ensures that the examples work with the code.

Comments that appear after ```//!``` provide documentation for the item that contains the comments itself. Typically, these style comments are included at the top of the crate root file (*src/lib.rs*). Documentation comments within items are useful for describing crates and modules especially. Use them to explain the overall purpose of the container to help your users understand the crate's organization.

---
**Exporting a Convenient Public API with ```pub use```**<br>
You can re-export items to make a public structure that's different from the private structure by using ```pub use```. Re-exporting takes a public item in one location and makes it public in another location (as if it were defined in the other location instead).

Utilizing ```pub use``` enables flexibility with respect to structuring the crate internally by allowing you to decouple the internal strcuture from the API presented to users.

To learn how to publish crates to crates.io look [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html).

### Cargo Workspaces <a name="workspace"></a>

A *workspace* is a set of packages that share the same *Cargo.lock* and output directory. An example structure of a workspace could consist of a binary and two libraries such that the binary depends on both libraries.

This section may be more useful in the future and, at that point in time, I can review [this section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html) in [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/).

**Installing Binaries from Crate.io with ```cargo install```**<br>
All binaries installed with ```cargo install``` are stored in the installation rootâ€™s *bin* folder. If you installed Rust using *rustup.rs* and donâ€™t have any custom configurations, this directory will be *$HOME/.cargo/bin*. Ensure that directory is in your ```$PATH``` to be able to run programs youâ€™ve installed with ```cargo install```.

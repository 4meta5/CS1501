> I think you’re pretty deep in finance and I’d never try and steer you away from that but this technology is going to manage all of our digital interactions and we can essentially buy shares in it. We don’t know who the winner will be but that’s investing. There’s a lot more than just the tech in this space...the people who really control this space: Vitalik, Vlad, Karl—they aren’t brilliant coders but they have great intuition when it comes to economics/game theory and incentive management. Radical Markets is a book that we’ve talked about and it discusses Quadratic Voting. Many of these mechanisms could fundamentally change how we vote and you might come back with the argument that this will never be implemented or not soon because of red tape but I’m not claiming it’ll change how we vote for president or something like that—I’m talking about the basic interactions that we have with other participants inside an app. If we don’t have to use a gatekeeper to babysit all state changes, then we could build creative transaction structures. As an example, a crowdfunding contact that could establish identity and then match contributions to a cause with nonlinear payoffs. So, maybe the contract matches a significantly higher percentage of contributions if more individual people contributed relative to if there was just a few large donations. This is the paper that Vitalik came out with two days ago. Quadratic Voting is a construction that enables us to weight votes to provide people with the ability to voice their preferences so that the result of votes is no longer based on the tyranny of the majority but, instead, it is a calculation of the aggregate preferences of the population. The QV paper covers this. Honestly, in terms of area of expertise, I think you, me, and a good number of others could really innovate in this space because it requires certain intuition wrt incentive loops. I think you get that intuition from closely watching markets.

## Identity <a name="identity"></a>

For this lecture, we're going to blackbox identity. By doing so, we can build creative market mechanisms on top of it! There are more than a few very interesting articles relating to how the blockchain can help us create a graph of attestations to enable Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):

> "The central idea of the omitted formal proof is that quadratic functions are the only ones with linear derivatives and thus the only functions where a voter buying votes equates her marginal benefit and cost at a number of votes proportional to her value."

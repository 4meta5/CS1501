# Schedule <a name="schedule"></a>

This program is 12 weeks long. It starts by introducing [JavaScript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript) before gradually increasing the amount of time spent on blockchain side projects. **To join this program, email ars9he@virginia.edu**

> We encourage students to spend *at least* 1 hour a day for any program that they decide to follow.

The program is split into 6 **two-week sprints**. Each sprint focuses on different aspects of JavaScript and blockchain programming. The last 3 sprints are personalized depending on the progress made by the student.
* [Introducing JavaScript and Blockchain](#sprint1)
* [React](#sprint2)
* [Aragon](#sprint3)
* [Extra](#extra)

This program is extremely malleable. **Where we start and how far we go depends entirely on the student's background and level of commitment**.

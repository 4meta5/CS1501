State channels rely heavily on posting collateral in order to engage in off-chain messaging. Although collateral ensures that a cost is attached to each submission, this model of only pushing batch transactions to the blockchain increases the amount of risk involved in a single transaction. Specifically, by increasing attacker incentives, this model of minimizing interaction with the blockchain may be insecure. This may especially hold true if not enough collateral is posted to ensure sufficient incentive to behave during settlement or dispute resolution. 

We are looking for students interested in doing research on this topic. We will explore collateralized debt models from structured finance to understand how risks for overcollateralization are usually determined. Then, we will consider the other factors that make state channels unique. The object oriented nature of state channel frameworks like [Counterfactual](https://counterfactual.com/statechannels) should shape how applications manage layer 2 user interactions. We may also investigate other state channel frameworks.

Responsibilities:
* Research CLOs, ABS, and the risks associated with rehypothecation in Finance
* Understand and research how applications will manage collateral when using Counterfactual Framework (may require contacting the L4/Counterfactual team)
* Requires learning Latex (not very hard and worth learning if interested in research)
* May involve coding in Solidity, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python

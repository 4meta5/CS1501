# CS1501
UVA Introduction to Blockchain
[Website](https://uvablockchain.gitbook.io)

**Tracks**
This class provides students with a high-level introduction to blockchain technology. Students taking the class come from diverse backgrounds including Math, Physics, Computer Science, Economics, Finance, Public Policy, Philosophy, and Law. With this in mind, our core objective is to provide a holistic introduction to blockchain with an emphasis on the underlying technology. To achieve this objective, we are splitting the class into 3 [Tracks](#Tracks):
1. [Cryptography](#Cryptography)
2. [Cryptoeconomics](#Cryptoeconomics)
3. [BUIDL](#BUIDL)

A description of each of the tracks is provided in later sections (linked above). In addition, more information is included in the Track directory.

**Lecture**
The materials from each week's lecture (powerpoint, lecture notes, etc.) are stored in the numbered directories (ie 1, 2, ...). The lecture notes complement the powerpoint. In class, we will cover content from all 3 Tracks.

**Projects**
We also encourage students to build software and interact with the blockchain. Over the course of the semester, students will be notified of opportunities to contribute to active projects. In addition, we plan to eventually develop infrastructure to encourage the formation of teams around project proposals.
<!-- 
Tacit organization:
--create mappings between projects and lectures and tracks

## Tracks
There are three main tracks for the UVA CS1501 Introduction to Blockchain:
1. [Cryptography](#Cryptography)
2. [Cryptoeconomics](#Cryptoeconomics)
3. [BUIDL](#BUIDL)

Students may participate in 1, 2, or all 3 tracks. Each track will provide participants with reading resources. In class, we will cover a mix of all three tracks, but likely focus on Cryptoeonomics. In the future, we may offer other activities/opportunities for students in each track.

We are also very interested in adding a *subtrack* under [BUIDL](#BUIDL) focused on hardware. Get in contact with us via *smerkle@protonmail.ch* if you are interested in joining.

One of our core goals is to provide as many mappings between tracks as possible. It is extremely important for students to identify the connections between the material in the tracks. In the future, we will encourage [Projects](#projects) that incorporate work from multiple tracks.

### Cryptography
This track focuses on the cryptography related to blockchain technology. The material will focus on academic papers but may also cite informal resources on discussion boards, social media feeds, and blog posts.

The [Cryptography](#Cryptography) track will work closely with the UVA Blockchain Research Lab.

Week 1:
* Basics of Hash Functions by Consensys
  * Merkle Trees 
* Byzantine Generals Problem
* PBFT
* B Dai Money
* HashCash
* Bitcoin's Academic Pedigree

**Subsequent material for each track will be posted under the tracks directory.**

### Cryptoeconomics
This track focuses on economics, governance, and incentive management. **Incentive loops** are the *magic sauce* of blockchain protocols and communities. By studying the construction of permissionless incentive loops, we can help students grasp the more subtle features that enable (to some extent) *decentralization* and *trustless* dispute resolution. Moreover, by understanding the incentive dynamics behind blockchain actors, we can help students realize the limitations of modern blockchain protocols.

Week 1:
* Incentive Loops
* [Let's Ditch "Decentralized"](http://www.tonysheng.com/decentralized-definition)

Extra (new paper came out by Vitalik on Monday):
* (pre-req): QV by Weyl and Posner
* Liberal Radicalism

**Subsequent material for each track will be posted under the tracks directory.**

### BUIDL
This tracks focuses on helping students build software that interacts with the blockchain. This track will provide resources oriented towards coding tutorials and practical examples. It is our hope that the work in this track closely corresponds to the [Projects](#Projects). We organize resources in this track according to programming language. Our favorite programming languages are Rust, Golang, Solidity, Python, Javascript/ES6, and WebAssembly (but we may only focus on a few).

Week 1:

Rust Resources:
* Parity/Substrate/Polkadot videos
* Parachain and Relayer project
* The Rust Book

Solidity Resources:
* Zombie Game
* Consensys Contracts
* TokenContracts
* I have a bunch of github repos
* Declarative Contract Structures
* Proxy Patterns OpenZeppelin

Golang Resources:
* GoETH free online book
* GoBook

Javascript/ES6:
* learning ES6, typescript, etc.
* Truffle Tools
* React, Redux for state management, etc.

Python:
* PyETH
* PiperMerriam and Vitalik githubs

## Projects
Knowledge Graph is under construction. 

ScaleNetwork Information and Roles

Other Ideas:
(1) Staking Facilities
(2) Hardware Experimentation
(3) Building a DAO with Aragon and IPFS
(4) Building a District0x clone
(5) Trading systems that use KnowledgeGraph (happy to help with this)
(6) 

## Managing Contributions
Pando or Sourcecred (need to set up, but so far it'll be informal)
--easy way to do this is to accept updates once a week for anyone who is contributing on how many hours and what they did

## Proposal




## Proposal

AraEagles is a proposal for the _Eagles on the blockchain_ call for projects, with the intent of implementing a fully ERC721-compliant AragonOS app that tokenizes eagles on the blockchain.

Our approach is novel since we want to implement AraEagles as a parachain by using Polkadot, therefore avoiding the clutter that eagles on the blockchain would produce on the Ethereum blockchain. Our research has shown that without doing our own parachain, we could potentially endanger the Ethereum network.

We are a driven team willing to take on this project and work on it for the next year.

## Proposal
```


# ProjectName

## 

Model this after EIPs but make it as short as possible
```
proposal: {
        project_summary: __,
        github: ___,
        other_resources: ___,
        name (optional): __,
}

```
When a proposal is submitted, it is first sent into a discussion feed. It must achieve some level of support before it can be formally added to the list of open projects. Open projects usually have roles posted that describe an informal criteria that may be suitable for the position. We encourage any involved projects to be accessible to students of all experience levels. 

Open Projects

My list of projects:
* Knowledge Graphs
* State Channel Projects
* Learning Rust and Solidity
* Working with NuCypher tools in Python to learn about file encryption (other encryption tasks like file encryption)

# Cryptography

# Economics/Governance
Governance based on Radical Markets Book:
* Quadratic Voting
* Liberal Radicalism

# BUIDL
For projects, we will encourage students to form teams to explore promising software in the space. We believe that now is a very good time to learn how to interact with permissionless networks.

Coming Soon Maybe (Hardware)
Need to find someone to fill this position.
